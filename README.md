# Zillow Short Sale Bot

This repository contains scripts for scraping Zillow short sale listings and contacting agents via SMS or email.

## SMS

SMS sending uses [SMS Gateway for Android](https://api.smstext.app).  Provide the API key via the `sms_gateway_api_key` field in `config.json` or the `SMS_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable.  The provider can be set with `sms_provider`, but currently only `android_gateway` is supported.

## Google Custom Search

Agent contact details are looked up using the Google Custom Search API. Provide credentials via environment variables:

* `CS_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` – your Google API key
* `CS_CX` or `GOOGLE_CX` – the Custom Search Engine ID

With these variables set, the bot queries Google directly instead of relying on Apify for search results.

## RapidAPI Zillow data

The bot fetches listing details from the RapidAPI Zillow data source. Set your credentials via the environment:

* `RAPID_KEY` – your RapidAPI key
* `RAPID_HOST` – the RapidAPI host (defaults to `us-housing-market-data1.p.rapidapi.com`)

If you previously used the old host (`zillow-com1.p.rapidapi.com`), update your environment to the new default so the RapidAPI requests continue to work. The bot will now log a warning and automatically switch to `us-housing-market-data1.p.rapidapi.com` if it sees the deprecated host in the environment.
